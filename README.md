# Bitcoin-forecast

This is just for fun project.

I collected Bitcoin data from CoinMarketCap, which provided me historical Bitcoin prices and other related metrics.
I started by gathering data on key metrics such as Bitcoin price, market capitalization, trading volume,
and other relevant factors that could impact Bitcoin's value over time.

Next, I used the SARIMAX model to develop a forecasting model for Bitcoin "closing" prices.
This allowed me to predict future price trends and identify potential market opportunities for investors.

To build the SARIMAX model, I first preprocessed and cleaned the data, removing any missing or erroneous values.
Then, I used statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships within the data.
This allowed me to develop a robust forecasting model that could make accurate predictions based on historical data.
However, this model version is not fine-tuned.

Once the model was built, I tested it against historical data to assess its accuracy and identify any potential areas for improvement.
I also used visualization tools to create graphs that helped me visualize the model's performance and identify any trends or patterns in the data.
