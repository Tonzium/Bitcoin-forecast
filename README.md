# Bitcoin-forecast

This is a "just for fun" project.

I collected Bitcoin data from CoinMarketCap, which provided me with historical Bitcoin prices and other related metrics.
I began by gathering data on key metrics such as Bitcoin price, market capitalization, and trading volume.

To build a forecasting model, I first preprocessed and cleaned the data, removing any missing or erroneous values.
Then, I used statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships within the data.
This allowed me to develop a robust forecasting model that could make accurate predictions based on historical data. However, I didn't do the fine-tuning.

I used the SARIMAX model to develop a forecasting model for Bitcoin "closing" prices.
This enabled me to predict future price trends and identify potential market opportunities.

Once the model was built, I tested it against historical data to assess its accuracy and identify any potential areas for improvement.
I also used visualization tools to create graphs that helped me visualize the model's performance and identify any trends or patterns in the data.
